This is an Unsupervised Learning Approach to make the Clusters on the basis of some ingredients:
fixed acidity, 
volatile, 
acidity, 
citric acid, 
residual sugar, 
chlorides free, 
sulfur dioxide,	
total sulfur dioxide,	
density, pH, sulphates, 
alcohol, 
quality. 
And i have applied "KMeans Clustering" to do it so.
